# Waste-Sorter

This was my first attempt at building an image classifier using the fastai library, trained to sort different types of trash. The test accuracy was really high, 92%. I also wrote a [code walkthrough](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-image-classifier-for-waste-sorting-6d11d3c9c478) on Medium.

All the code for this project is in **`Waste sorter.ipynb`**. 

## How to view this project

The notebook is too big to render on Github, which is why we have to use Jupyter Notebook Viewer to render it. Start with option (a) and if the link doesn't work, use option (b).

### Option (a) 

- Click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/collindching/Waste-Sorter/blob/master/Waste%20sorter.ipynb)

### Option (b)

1. Copy the link to the notebook on Github (https://github.com/collindching/Waste-Sorter/blob/master/Waste%20sorter.ipynb)
2. Follow this link [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the notebook URL to view the notebook

## How to run this notebook

1. Download **`Waste sorter.ipynb`**
2. Download the corresponding dataset [here](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip) and move it to the same directory as the notebook
3. Run the notebook in Anaconda
